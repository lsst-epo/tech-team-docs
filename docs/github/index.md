# Github

## Github Teams

**Core** is for EPO team members

**Contractors** is for any external contributors

## Pull Requests

Github repos are configured to only allow PRS to "Rebase and merge".

## Open Source Repositories

Open Source repositories should have both Issues and Discussion enabled.

## Other Special Repositories

Certain repositories act as either template repos or base Docker images. It is crucial that these are not removed unless the idea is to altogether remove the template or Docker base image. The repos will have "template" or "base-image" in the name. The base images in particular should not be altered unless you are knowledgeable of all the Dockerfiles that make use of the base image as there may be unintended bugs that arise if so.
